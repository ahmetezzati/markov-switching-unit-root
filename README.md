This code is designed for a three-regime Markov Switching model with one lag.
If the number of regimes or the number of lags is modified, please make sure to adjust the corresponding EM algorithm settings within the code accordingly.

The number of bootstrap replications in this code is set to 100 by default.
Additionally, the code extracts the distribution of the t-statistics separately for each regime.
